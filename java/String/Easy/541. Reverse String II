Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters 
counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. 
If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Restrictions:
The string consists of lower English letters only.
Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

# 三种情况可以合并为1种，只需注意reverse时第二种情况（If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them.）的下标end：

class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        if(k <= 1)
            return s;
        int l = s.length(), i = 0, start, end;
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        char tmp;
        while(i < l) {
            start = i;
            end = Math.min(l - 1, i + k - 1);
            while(start < end) {
                tmp = c[start];
                c[start++] = c[end];
                c[end--] = tmp;
            }
            i += 2 * k;
        }
        return new String(c);
    }
}
