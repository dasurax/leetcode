Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

# 使用异或操作。XOR of two equal numbers is 0 : a^a=0。

class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int single = 0;
        for(int num: nums) {
            single ^= num;
        }
        return single;
    }
}
